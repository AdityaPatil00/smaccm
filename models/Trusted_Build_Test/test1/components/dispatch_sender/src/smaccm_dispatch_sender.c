   ***AUTOGENERATED CODE: DO NOT MODIFY***

  This C file contains the dispatcher functions for the 'active' thread 
  sender.  There is no direct interaction between the functionality in 
  this file and user-level code.  Instead, this file interacts with the 
  aadl-generated C file for passive components and the CAmkES generated
  component skeleton.

  This file contains: 
  	1.) The main loop for the control thread to dispatch to 
  		components
  	2.) The dispatcher functions for all passive components.
  	3.) The shared data for any of the active thread send/receive ports.
  	4.) The receiver functions to store messages and wake up the 
  		control thread.
  	5.) The sender functions for other "active" components.
